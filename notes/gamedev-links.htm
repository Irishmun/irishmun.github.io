        <p>
            Throughout the years, I’ve come across a large variety of websites that in one way or another have been
            quite the benefit to my creative efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are a fair few that have been quite nice or have been interesting to try out.

        <h3><a href="https://kenney.nl/">- kenney nl</a></h3>
        <span>Kenney has made a large variety of models, textures and sprites over the years, all of which are free
            and fall under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> license.<br>
            He frequently releases new assets, so checking here often can be worth it.<br>
            He accepts donations, has some paid tools/games and also provides a <a
                href="https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets">all-in-one</a> package which has all his free
            assets in one bundle that gets updated with all the new assets when they come out.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://polyhaven.com/">- polyhaven </a></h3>
        <span>Polyhaven is a "Public 3D Asset Library" has a large library of textures, models and HDRI's,
            all of which are free and fall under the <a
                href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> license.<br>
            They frequently release new assets, which are all of high quality. The texture downloads come with a lot of
            options to choose which parts you want to download and in what format.
            <p>

                They also have a blender plugin that allows you to import it directly to a project, without having to
                download it manually beforehand. I've used these textures quite a few times in my projects, <a
                    href="https://afterdarkgames.itch.io/godot-first-person-movement">released</a> and not.
            </p>
        </span>
        <aside>
            At some point, they introduced "vaults", which they call a temporary pay wall that, once enough funding has
            been reached it'll become freely accessible like their other assets.
            Alternatively, you could become part of their patreon and get access to it and their unreleased assets
            directly.

        <h3><a href="https://ambientcg.com/">- ambientcg </a></h3>
        <span>AmbientCG, like Polyhaven, is a large library of <a
                href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> assets that were made with the purpose
            of
            "Creating the best possible 3D assets, like materials, photo scans, HDRIs and more" to be shared freely on
            the internet.<br>
            Whilst I haven't used this site as much as polyhaven, it is just as good of a service and they both provide
            a similar enough set of assets that they can be easily used together.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.thebasemesh.com/">- the base mesh </a></h3>
        <span>A website containing a lot of plain models, all free to download and under the <a
                href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> license.<br>
            The models are to scale and have are basically ready to be textured, containing good topology and
            propper UV unwrapping.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/">- thoseawesomeguys prompts</a></h3>
        <span>Sprites for user inputs. You might have seen these before in a variety of (indie) games, these were
            designed to be as "generic" as possible.<br>
            This, alongside the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> license, has
            made it quite the nicety for using it as a game's input UI.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://pdimagearchive.org/">- Public Domain Image Archive </a></h3>
        <span>The Public Domain Image Archive (PDIA) has a huge assortment of images that have all gone out-of-copyright
            and thus entered the public domain to be used freely.<br>
            Whilst this site isn't a gamedev-first project, These images can still be used for various purposes,
            including, but not limited to, creating textures to use in games or as reference for historical imagery.<br>
            Besides, I really do like a lot of these images and find just <a
                href="https://pdimagearchive.org/images/df19c7b0-690b-4399-9ec7-23ed72c9ff5f/">looking at them</a> very
            interesting.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://texturefabrik.com/gallery/">- Texture Fabrik </a></h3>
        <span>One of my most recent findings (as of me making this page), Texture Fabrik has a variety of high quality
            images that can be used in the creation of textures/images of various kinds.<br>
            These images fall under their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donationware">donationware</a>
            licensing model, meaning that the product is free, but a donation can be made if desired.
            Otherwise they request that you'd credit them when using these images.<br>
            The also have a <a href="https://texturefabrik.com/tf-for-the-masses/">page</a> showing various ways that
            people have used their images in various works.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.materialmaker.org/">- Material Maker</a></h3>
        <span>A free and open source tool to make procedural materials using nodes, which can then be exported to an
            image set, or directly to a material to be used in Godot, Unity or Unreal Engine.</span>
        </p>

        <h2 id="MAPPING">Map making</h2>
        <aside>
            These sites provide tools and/or resources that have been useful when making levels.
        </aside>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/func-godot/func_godot_plugin">- func_godot</a></h3>
        <span>A direct successor to <a href="https://github.com/QodotPlugin/Qodot/">Qodot</a>, func_godot is a tool
            that allows the importing of quake <i>map</i> files (and source <i>vmf</i> files) into the godot game
            engine.<br>
            It has been quite nice as I find using the hammer editor far easier for level making, especially the
            early block-out stage.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://jack.hlfx.ru/en/">- J.A.C.K</a></h3>
        <span>J.A.C.K is a <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor_(GoldSrc)">Hammer
                editor</a> replacement, originally created by <a href="https://crystice.com/">Crystice Softworks</a> for
            their Volatile game engine and game: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/668320/Perilous_Warp/">
                Perilous warp</a>.<br>
            It does not require the installation of any of their games, nor any source game, meaning it can be used for
            most any project.<br>
            It can export the maps to the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/MAP_(file_format)">map</a>
            format, which can then be imported into, amongst other things, godot using the previously mentioned
            func_godot plugin.<br>
            I find the hammer level editor to be incredibly nice to work with, and this makes that far easier for
            non-source games.
            <p>
                The software can be downloaded for free from their website (the provided link here), or from <a
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/496450/JACK/">steam</a>, where it does cost money, but has
                more recent features, that usually becomes available in the free version when the paid version gets
                another major update.<br>
            </p>
            The only downside I find with this software is that it is closed source, so any desired changes cannot be
            made to it, unless the developers themselves decide it to be needed in any of their own games.
            With that said, the other issue I have with it is that you can only import textures as <a
                href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/WAD">wads</a>, jpegs, or TGA files.
            This leaves the most commonly used image format, png, out of the picture and would require some fenagling to
            properly use it.

        <h3><a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/">- Trenchbroom</a></h3>
        <span>Trenchbroom is a primarily QUAKE game level editor, but can be used to make levels for other games, as has
            been done quite a lot.<br>
            It has become quite popular over the years, especially due to func_godot, but I personally can't get into a
            good workflow with it, unlike Jack.<br>
            It has some features that Jack doesn't have that I do find quite nice, mainly the UV editor preview, which
            shows selected face on the texture it has, allowing you to see where and how it's positioned on it;
            Particularly nice when working with trim sheets or smaller faces.
            It's also open source, which combined with its large community results in a rather active development
            cycle, adding more features to it that make it far nicer to use.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">- Tiled</a></h3>
        <span>A 2D tile based level editor, this has been on my radar for quite some time.
            It exists and has been updated since way back in <a
                href="https://www.mapeditor.org/2004/06/15/tiled-030-released.html">2004</a> and has gotten it's 1.0
            release back in <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/2017/05/24/tiled-1-0-0-released.html">2017!</a>
            <p>
                I personally don't make many 2D games at the moment, but this is still something I really want to try
                out when I do go back to making a 2D game.<br>
                It is supported by many game engines in various ways and has a couple generic export formats to be used
                in other engines/systems that don't explicitly have support for it.
        </span>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3><a href="https://ldtk.io/">- LDtk</a></h3>
        <span>A more modern/recent tool, similar to Tiled, which had been made and developed alongside <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1662480/Nuclear_Blaze/">a game</a> to be used
            as a proof-of-concept.<br>
            Whilst lacking some functionality, as been stated by the developer himself, It too has quite a lot that I
            want to try out at some point.
            This means I'll have to decide between this and Tiled whenever I start work on a 2D game...</span>

            thing in and of itself.<br>
            It is constantly being updated with more sources, including talks from the <a
                href="https://gdcvault.com/">Game Developer Conference (GDC)</a>.<br>

        <span>A large resource of sprites, models, textures and audio files from most every game.
            These are mostly ripped by the community but are still very interesting to look at to get an idea of how a
            game asset has been made.<br>
