                                    Whilst music streaming is all fine and dandy, radio always brings a few things that
                                    just make me like it more, except for the <b>complete</b> lack of control over which
                                    music is playing. This should try and solve that.

                                I've found it quite weird how Windows doesn't have a built in way to generate audio with its text-to-speech voices.
                                This program allows you to do just that and export them to audio files.

                                    This demo was part of my graduation internship at Sorama BV. They had a VR demo for
                                    their then newest product, The CamIV64. I implemented missing features and overall,
                                    greatly optimised the demo.
